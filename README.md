🌟 Hi there! I’m Jocine Nabwire — a data enthusiast, financial strategist, and tech explorer.

🎓 Armed with a degree in Economics and Statistics, I've journeyed through the realms of data analysis, financial modeling, and impactful policy work with different organizations. My mission? To harness the power of data and technology to shape the future of finance and beyond.

💡 What I’m up to: I’m diving into the exciting worlds of venture capital, private equity, and software engineering, blending my analytical prowess with cutting-edge tech to solve complex problems. My GitHub is my playground — where code meets creativity and innovation thrives.

🌍 Beyond the screen: I’m a passionate advocate for sustainable development, with a keen interest in renewable energy investments. When I’m not crunching numbers or writing code, you’ll find me strategizing over the latest Manchester United match or planning my next big adventure.
